## üåü Overview

This directory contains all bounty submissions for the Ergo ecosystem. Each submission is a JSON file that follows a specific format and naming convention.

## üöÄ Bounty Process

- **Reserving a Bounty**: Submit a PR with a JSON file marked as `in-progress` to claim a bounty before starting work
- **Submitting Work**: Create or update a PR with your completed work details and set status to `awaiting-review`

Both processes use the same JSON template and PR workflow. Reservations are first-come, first-served.

## JSON File Format

Each submission must include the following required fields:

- `contributor`: Your GitHub username
- `wallet_address`: The address where payment should be sent
- `work_link`: Link to the PR where the work was completed
- `work_title`: A short title describing the work
- `payment_currency`: Currency for payment (e.g., ERG, SigUSD, RSN)
- `bounty_value`: The payment amount (numeric value)
- `status`: Current submission status (`in-progress`, `awaiting-review`, `approved`, `paid`)
- `submission_date`: Date of submission (leave empty for reservations)
- `expected_completion`: Estimated completion date (for reservations)

Additional recommended fields:

- `bounty_id`: The GitHub issue number in `{repo}#{issue_number}` format (if applicable)
- `contact_method`: A way for reviewers to reach out if they have questions
- `original_issue_link`: The full URL to the original issue or bounty
- `description`: A brief summary of the work completed

The following fields will be filled out by reviewers or automation:

- `reviewer`: GitHub username of the original issue author (automatically added by bot when PR is opened)
- `review_notes`: Notes from the reviewer
- `payment_tx_id`: Transaction ID of the payment
- `payment_date`: Date when payment was processed

## Review Process

1. Maintainers will review your submission
2. If approved, the PR will be merged
3. Payment will be processed based on the JSON details
4. The status will be updated to `paid` once payment is complete
